      <p class="lead">I build new capabilities for organizations tackling complex problems—from startups navigating regulation to established institutions driving innovation.</p>
      <p>I'm a product and strategy leader who thrives in ambiguous, high-stakes environments. I founded and scaled Leap Fund—one of the nation's first platforms addressing benefits cliffs, from concept to national reach, raising $2M+ in competitive nonprofit funding and testifying before Congress on policy implications. Before that, I spent 10+ years leading product at early-stage startups and driving digital transformation for Fortune 500 companies.
I specialize in building solutions where there's no playbook: navigating regulatory constraints, managing multi-stakeholder dynamics, and turning vision into execution in resource-constrained environments.</p>
      <p>I build 0-1 products, programs, and strategies in complex environments. This includes:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Product strategy &amp; development</b>: Designing and launching platforms, tools, and services from concept through scale</li>
          <li><b>Strategic initiatives</b>: Identifying new business opportunities, running experiments, and building business cases for new ventures</li>
          <li><b>Systems &amp; community design</b>: Creating solutions that work across tech, policy, operations, and human behavior</li>
          <li><b>Organizational change</b>: Translating vision into executable programs while navigating stakeholder complexity</li>
        </ul>  
      <p>I've worked across startups and Fortune 500s, in regulated and emerging industries, but what's consistent is the ability to build in ambiguity, constraint, and complexity.</p>
