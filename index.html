            <h2>Site history</h2>
                <p>This site began in 2014 focused on hiring more women in the tech industry, as I'd never worked at a tech company that had any more than 20% women (and most were woefully less than that). The conversation has evolved (rightly so) to advocacy for inclusion of other gender identities, people of color, LGBTQAI+, people with different abilities, and more. We knew even then that we'd like to see more people with diverse experiences and identities in design, product, project management, community, finance, and leadership positions in general, as it creates a healthier workplace, and better products and services. A diverse workplace is proven to get better results, more accurately reflects your customer/client base, and ensures a wider range of experience. Though some of the language is definitely geared towards women, I have updated and expanded this collection of data, metrics, and studies to speak to inclusion and equity efforts more broadly. I have also inserted dates for articles - I hope this resource is helpful!</p>

It's why holding blind auditions for orchestras increase women's chances of advancing to final rounds by 50%. It's why professors who receive requests for mentorship from prospective students are less likely to respond if the request comes from a woman.

            <h3>The premise of "We Only Hire The Best Candidates"</h3>
            
            <p>The idea is not to hire people just because of their gender or other identities. <strong>Hire women &amp; non-binary people that are amazing at their jobs</strong>. Own the responsibility of actually getting the word out to the widest pool of candidates possible. Employee referrals may fill your open roles, but they have been shown to tend to benefits white men most (<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2023-08-26/employee-referral-programs-for-job-openings-hurt-diversity-efforts" target="_blank">Bloomberg article</a>, 2023)(paywalled). If you're only getting male candidates, perhaps the problem lies with either how you're describing the position, or the pool of candidates who are actually seeing the job post. And of note: if you have an employee referral program, it may make sense to review whether it actually works to get you a diversity of candidates (or violates US law) - HBR has ideas on <a href="https://hbr.org/2018/03/how-to-use-employee-referrals-without-giving-up-workplace-diversity" target="_blank">how to structure employee referrals more equitably</a>, 2018.</p>

  <h2>DEI backlash</h2>
  <p>A growing body of academic research highlights the ongoing backlash against DEI (Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion) programs in tech—despite overwhelming evidence that they help marginalized professionals thrive.</p>
  <h3>Recent academic studies:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>The Tech DEI Backlash</strong>: A 2025 study across 10 software companies maps how organizations are shrinking or rebranding DEI efforts. <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14232" target="_blank">Cornell University arXiv</a>, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>From Diverse Origins to a DEI Crisis</strong>: Analysis of Reddit posts from developers reveals anxiety and resistance during the DEI rollback. <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16821" target="_blank">Cornell University arXiv</a>, 2025</li>

  </ul>
  <p>
  <h3>DEI under attack — a political rollback</h3>
  <p>In early 2025, the Trump administration launched a coordinated dismantling of DEI programs in federal agencies, public universities, and government contracts.</p>
  <h4>Key Events and Their Impact:</h4>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Executive Order 14173</strong>: Revoked federal DEI mandates. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_Order_14173" target="_blank">Wikipedia, EO 14173</a></li>
    <li><strong>Defunding and Investigations</strong>:
      <ul>
        <li>UVA president resigned under federal pressure. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jun/29/trump-threats-university-of-virginia-mark-warner" target="_blank">The Guardian</a>, 2025</li>
        <li>MIT closed DEI offices, lost $35M in funding. <a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/opinion/article/trump-dei-20166006.php" target="_blank">SF Chronicle</a>, 2025</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Big Tech walks DEI back:</strong>Meta, Amazon and Google scrubbed DEI references in their latest annual reports. <a href=https://observer.com/2025/02/annual-reports-meta-amazon-alphabet-dei-shift/ target="_blank">Observer</a>, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>NASA and Agency Content Purge</strong>: The Trump administration’s attacks on diversity could lead to more accidents in space missions. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/space/629948/space-science-dei-diversity-nasa-trump" target="_blank">The Verge</a>, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Disproportionate Harm to Black Women</strong>: DEI rollback has disproportionately impacted Black women, upending long-serving civil servants careers, despite their jobs having no direct connection to diversity initiatives. <a href="https://theatlantavoice.com/federal-workers-black-women-impacted-dei-rollback/" target="_blank">The Atlanta Voice</a>, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Global Impact</strong>: DEI pullbacks could weaken gender-responsive international development efforts, particularly in funding and policy influence. <a href="https://www.developmentaid.org/news-stream/post/192344/the-impact-of-u-s-dei-policies-rollback" target="_blank">DevelopmentAid</a>, 2025</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
  <h3>Why this matters</h3>
  <p>As corporate and federal support for DEI shrinks, the professionals it was built to protect face renewed vulnerability. Yet academic research (and lived experience!) proves that intentional, sustained, and inclusive policy still matters.</p>
  <br>
    <p>We can’t afford silence. We need:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Continued investment in mentorship, community, and equitable practices</li>
    <li>Legal and organizational resilience against political pressure</li>
    <li>More research—not less—on what works for inclusion</li>
  </ul>

            <p>Get more women &amp; non-binary folks in during the interview process. Even if your post isn't overly bro-oriented, are you sending cues that your workplace has the potential to be unwelcoming, or even toxic?</p>
            
            <p>*NOTE: Hopefully, this gendered language issue transforms and evolves in the coming years - this is simply an effort to identify what affects applicants NOW, and to build up and expand the applicant pool for the widest funnel possible.</p>

                <p>The main point here is that language matters. Women &amp; non-binary people can be (and are) all of these things in the "average" sections: competitive, dominant, and strong, but it's worth noting that this wording is often a cue for an atmosphere and culture that is unwelcoming. (H/T <a href="https://twitter.com/tqbf/status/582993969027526657" target="_blank">Thomas H. Ptacek</a> for a critical conversation about these words as "gendered," and highlighted the following points: not removing words such as competitive, especially if the environment IS competitive, and you're seeking candidates that thrive in that environment, and that paying attention to the language you use, and what it signals, is critical to finding great candidates).</p>
                
                <p>There's no universal "right answer" for the exact wording that is best. Look back at your company's mission, values, and goals for guideposts on the best ways to explain what you're looking for, and to entice people to your company and its culture.</p>

                <p>"If companies look at this from a business perspective, they are literally flushing resources down the toilet if the person they recruited, interviewed, hired, on-boarded, and employed for two years quits because the environment is (at best) not a fit or (at worst) blatantly sexist.

All of the resources that go into finding and hiring women (and other underrepresented groups, but I can speak to my experience best) should very quickly be rerouted to retention and promotion." - <a href="https://www.wired.com/2017/05/cant-retain-women-dont-recruit/" target="_blank">Kate Buckholz</a>, Wired, 2017</p>

The mosquito bite metaphor works great for me here. One bite is annoying, a few bits are irritating, but a lot of bites are intolerable. It is easy to dismiss one or two inappropriate comments, a dozen gets very tiresome, but many is like death by a 1000 paper cuts. When you hear inappropriate comments, or if you are reproducing them yourself, pause and question yourself, would you make those comments to a man? If not, stop.

This 50/50 ratio leaves out non-binary, and other marginalized genders, so, take the 50/50 gender split example with a grain of salt.

[To this end,] Slack rebuilt the interview process. For each role, the team determined what characteristics and skills a successful candidate should have---communication skills, say, or capacity for teamwork. Then, for each of these, they defined what information they needed to assess those skills, and then devised a list of behavioral questions expressly aimed at sussing out that information. [Additionally], interviewers were asked to do mock interviews with existing employees, the way doctors practice on fake patients. The interviewers themselves became more skilled---and less likely to introduce biases that could filter out good candidates." - <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2018/04/how-slack-got-ahead-in-diversity/558806/" target="_blank">How Slack Got Ahead in Diversity, Jessica Nordell / The Atlantic</a>, 2018</p>

Define target criteria upfront and use a structured interview process to consistently evaluate candidates on these criteria and to mitigate unconscious bias from creeping in. It can be easy to justify biased decisions post-hoc by changing criteria. Writing down the exact language, prompts, a grading rubric, etc., is helpful to make sure that candidates are evaluated consistently.
