This site began in 2014 focused on hiring more women in the tech industry, as I'd never worked at a tech company that had any more than 20% women (and most were woefully less than that). The conversation has evolved (rightly so) to advocacy for inclusion of other gender identities, people of color, LGBTQAI+, people with different abilities, and more. We knew even then that we'd like to see more people with diverse experiences and identities in design, product, project management, community, finance, and leadership positions in general, as it creates a healthier workplace, and better products and services. A diverse workplace is proven to get better results, more accurately reflects your customer/client base, and ensures a wider range of experience. Though some of the language is definitely geared towards women, I have updated and expanded this collection of data, metrics, and studies to speak to inclusion and equity efforts more broadly. I have also inserted dates for articles - I hope this resource is helpful!
