        <h3>Leap Fund</h3>
        <p>A leading nationally recognized organization focused on benefits cliff (earning more, but losing critical public benefits that were worth much more than the increase). I founded Leap Fund and served as CEO for 7 years, and transitioned to Leap Fund's Advisory in late 2024. Created a benefits cliff calculator for benefits recipients to understand their own benefit cliff potential; created a revenue generating Benefits Cliff Coaching Program, to train and resource coaches across the country; engaged 5 years of benefits cliff interventions with employers, including designing and piloting an employer based financial solution; and engaged public education and policy, including presenting Leap Fund's work to the U.S. House Committee on Rules. Supported by Blue Ridge Labs and The Robin Hood Foundation, Acumen+, Access Ventures, The Workers Lab, Google for Startups, and more.</p>
